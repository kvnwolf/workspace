# IMPORTANT: Philosophy - Entropy Reminder

This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut becomes someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

- Make illegal states unrepresentable through types and data structures
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes over broad refactors

# Communication

- Always communicate in SPANISH
- **IMPORTANT**: code, documentation, and issue/PR comments (Linear, GitHub) must be written in ENGLISH

# Code Style

- **NEVER** write code comments unless I ask you to do so
- When adding dependencies, **NEVER** add them directly to the `package.json`, install them using (Bun if the project has a bun.lock, pnpm if pnpm-lock.yaml)

# Tools

- When interacting with GitHub use the `gh` cli
- When performing web searches that require a year, **ALWAYS** use the **CURRENT YEAR** (2026)

# Skills

**BEFORE** starting any task, review available skills. If a skill exists for the task at hand, **USE IT** - do not improvise workflows or invent methodologies.

Skills encode tested patterns and domain knowledge. Trust them over ad-hoc approaches.
